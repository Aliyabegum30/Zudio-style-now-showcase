## Project Overview
This project showcases a fashion-focused website inspired by Zudio.  
It was created using a no-code platform (Base44) through prompt engineering as part of my work in the Prompt Engineering & Freelancing Club.

The goal was to design a clean, modern UI and a smooth user experience for browsing fashion collections.

## What I Worked On
- Website structure and layout design
- Prompt engineering for page creation
- UI/UX flow and visual consistency
- Deployment and live testing

## Tools Used
- Base44  
- Prompt Engineering  
- UI/UX Design Principles  

## Note
This repository is meant for **documentation and portfolio showcase**.  
The platform does not allow exporting the full source code.
